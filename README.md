### :bulb: What is Hogwarts Houses?
This a Harry Potter themed student and dormitory register application. This is my first Spring Boot application, so the focus was on getting familiar with this framework. Other technologies like JavaScript, CSS, HTML are represented on a necessary minimum level. Data is stored in memory.
### :arrow_forward: Try It Out!
The application is deployed on Heroku, so you can try it by clicking on this link:
